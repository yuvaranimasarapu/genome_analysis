This is my repository for the Lab project in the course Genome Analysis spring 2019 at Uppsala University. I worked with Durian Fruit genome.

The following is the structure of my repository:

code - all my bash scripts are here along with some text files in which you can find some commands run without scripts for certain softwares and tools.

raw_data - softlinks to all the rawdata i used. Also contains the 49 genes provided by the authors of the paper for phylogenetic analysis.

results images - screenshots of results and quality reports that i ran during the analysis.

Have a look at my wiki for more details!!!
